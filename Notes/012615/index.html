	<h3>Notes for Monday, Jan. 26. Objects</h3>

	<div>
		Last time we looked at functions. Now we're going to look at how javascript handles objects.
	</div>
	<div>
		Creating an object literal. A great introduction to object literals is the <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> page. JSON is designed to be valid Javascript, but a very restricted subset. You can't write functions. All keys must be in double quotes.
		<script>
		// This statement sets the value of the variable "widget" to an object literal. The object has two attributes, a string and a function.
		var widget = { "foo" : "Snow", 
		 				"sayHi" : function () { console.log("Hi!"); } };
		</script>
	</div>
	<div>
		How do we deal with objects from other code? How do we know what the properties of an object are?
		<script>
		// We can list the properties of an object:
		Object.getOwnPropertyNames(widget);

		// Listing properties tells us something about how arrays are implemented:
		Object.getOwnPropertyNames([1, 2, "blue"]);
		</script>
	</div>
	<div>
		We refer to the properties of an object from a function inside that object using the keyword <tt>this</tt>.
		<script>
var thisWidget = { "foo" : "Snow", 
	 		"sayHi" : function () { console.log(this.foo); } };
		</script>
	</div>
	<div>
		What are some ways we create objects?
		<script>
		// This function will return an object literal. Calling it multiple times will return different objects that have the same property names and values.
		var widgetGenerator = function () {
			return { "foo" : "Snow", 
	 		"sayHi" : function () { console.log(this.foo); } };
		};
		
		// We can also define something that looks more like the constructor methods you might be used to from Java.
		// This is just a function like any other. It refers to a variable called "this".
		var Widget = function () {
			this.foo = "Snow";
			this.sayHi = function () { console.log(this.foo); };
		};
		
		// [Note that outside the context of a function, the variable "this" is a
		//  "Window" object. This statement should produce "undefined":
		this.foo;

		// If we call the Widget() function directly, like this:
		var widget = Widget();
		// ... then Javascript interprets the "this" variable in the function as referring
		//  to the Window object. "this.foo" should now be a string.

		// If we add the "new" keyword before the function, this acts more like 
		//  the constructor functions you might be used to in languages like Java.
		// Javascript first creates an empty object {}, then calls the function
		//  with "this" set to that object. When the function ends, the return 
		//  value is that object, which in this case will now contain two properties.
		var widget = new Widget();
		
		</script>
	</div>
